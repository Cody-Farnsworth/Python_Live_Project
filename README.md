# Python_Live_Project
Live Project:
 
Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I developed a full scale Web Application in Python using django. Working on a python codebase was a great learning opportunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and learning new functionalities. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. Over the two week sprint I developed a fully functional website. I learned how to implement the use of Databases, API, and web scraping in order to make my website have more depth along with developing a better UI.This project taught me a ton of skills in using python and django that i will take into future projects.
 
Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on. I have provided snips of the codes as well in a seperate folder all labed for what part of the project they go to.
 
API:
MY API code that I developed is to help my user manually look up something by name. My task was to find and apply an API that could look up specific details of my chosen subject.
 
 
Web Scraping:
Here I was tasked with using Beautiful Soup to scrape info for my chosen subject and display it. I decided that a how-to page about my subject was a perfect way to display my knowledge of Beautiful Soup.The best part of this code is it allows you to divide up the given info into chunks allowing you to move them freely on the front end page so you can display them in a more dynamic way.
 
 
 
Database:
The database was a little more in depth then required as I made two separate databases that coexist with one another. Allowing the user to make a collection and then add new items into that specific collection. This then lets the front end web page display specific databases for better stored info.
 
 
FrontEnd:
The front end work I wanted to work on and show off was my navigation bar and its use of a dropdown and its styling.
